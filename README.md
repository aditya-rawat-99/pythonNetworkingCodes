Networking stuff with python

Suppose you have several links of important web pages that you have to send to someone.
Instead of copying each link and sending it to your friend or colleague, you can run this script and just copy each link.

Thats it, there is no need to save each link, no pressing of special keys or clicking mouse each time to save the link.
Just plain old CTRL-C on each link you want to send to your friend/colleague. The links will be saved automatically in a seperate 
shelve file and when you are done, just press CTRL-C and enter your email and password and email of the recipient.

Thats it! 
Nothing too tricky.
